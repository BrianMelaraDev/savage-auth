# Savage Fan Site
This Application allows users to log into the 21 Savage fan site welcoming the user with an interace including data assosiated with the user. In the interface the user can add their favorite 21 savage song and see a live feed of other songs other users include. Users can also like the songs or dislike and delete the comments as well.
